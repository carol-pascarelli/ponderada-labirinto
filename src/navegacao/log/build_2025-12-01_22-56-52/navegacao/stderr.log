[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcg_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "cg_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cg_interfaces"
  with any of the following names:

    cg_interfacesConfig.cmake
    cg_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cg_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "cg_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "cg_interfaces" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
